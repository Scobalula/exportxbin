# exportxbin

exportxbin is an enhanced version of export2bin included in the Call of Duty: Black Ops III Mod Tools. It's main goal is to provide users with the ability to convert XMODEL_BIN/XANIM_BIN to and from XMODEL_EXPORT/XANIM_EXPORT.

Features include:

* Drag and Drop Files and Folders
* Multi-threaded
* Convert EXPORT/BIN to and from each other.

This was made as a simple learning exercise for me to make something in pure C, it is unlikely it will receive new features but will receive bug fixes. Please file an issue if you found a bug. ðŸ’•

# Downloading

Simply grab the latest build from the [Releases](https://github.com/Scobalula/exportxbin/releases).

# Usage

To use exportxbin, you can simply drag and drop files/folder onto the exe and they will be converted.

You can also pass `/piped` to exportxbin to enter files in the command line.

# Why make another replacement?

Ultimately there is no other reason for me to make this other than I needed something to work on when away from my PC and so I decided to learn some C, and decided on writing my own replacement for export2bin in pure C as a good learning exercise.
